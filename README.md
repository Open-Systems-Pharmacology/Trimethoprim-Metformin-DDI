# Trimethoprim-Metformin-DDI
Modeling of published clinical Trimethoprim-Metformin-DD(G)I studies for model evaluation

### Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim project file containing simulations of all published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the trimethoprim model regarding the trimethoprim-metformin-DD(G)I, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied [metformin](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Metformin-Model) model has been published previously [[1](#reference)]. For further details and documentation please refer to [[2](#reference)].

### Version information
PK-Sim Version 8.0
